## Scope ##
This market is designed for the adventurer in all of us. Whether you want to get out and have a locals provided tour, or take in an exciting interactive experience you’re just a few clicks away from taking part in an exciting adventure.

## Summary ##

Using geolocation and virtual augmentation the user gets hints or ‘crumbs’ as they will be called to lead them on a live/virtual tour of their surroundings. This provides the ability for the ‘Crumblayer’ to leave clues, videos, sounds or virtual drawing to provide the client with an interactive experience.
This benefits multiple business avenues, encompassing tourism industry, local musicians and theatre troupes and any generic user who wants to provide a romantic memory for their significant other.

## Problem ##
This product solves an issue which is coming about with the commercialization of tourism. Many facets are sterilized and lacking flavor, this allows for an exciting and interactive experience. With user planned routes the locals become the tour guides.

## Solution ##
Providing an easy to use interface which can provide the user with content that has a special flavor that cannot be found with simply visiting a location.

In summary we are providing an interactive experience between content providers and clients. Giving the user or provider an assortment of options to guide the user through an interaction which can be educational, fun or general tourism. This will require a complex database of locational and content related storage, a well planned out interface and virtual augmentation to provide the user with a fully immersive experience.
